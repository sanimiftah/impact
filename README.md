# IMPACT – Planting Seeds of Change 🌱

**IMPACT** is a digital platform designed to unify and amplify Cognizant Outreach efforts across the Asia-Pacific region. Developed during Vibe Coding Week, this prototype reflects Cognizant’s commitment to care, innovation, and community engagement.

By centralizing volunteer opportunities, facilitating collaboration, and tracking meaningful contributions, IMPACT transforms scattered efforts into a cohesive ecosystem of change.
